# Code Refractor 

Horieson's website needed improvements to its code base.  I have refactored the site to improve it's accessibility.

This is my first homework assignment in WashU's software development program.  At first I found it very challenging 
but when it clicked it all seemed so obvious!  I learned much about HTML and CSS structure and semantics.  However, more
importantly I am learning how to learn; such as where I can seek help and good resources.
