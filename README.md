# Code Refractor 

This is my first homework assignment in WashU's software development program.  At first I found it very challenging 
but when it clicked it all seemed so obvious!  I learned much about HTML and CSS structure and semantics.  However, most
importantly I am learning how to learn; such as where I can seek help and creating a personal resource library.
